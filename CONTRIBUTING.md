## Reporting Issues

We always welcome bug reports, API proposals and overall feedback. Here are a few
tips on how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Where to Report

New issues can be reported in our [list of issues](https://github.com/imxieke/dev-template-php/issues).

Before filing a new issue, please search the list of issues to make sure it does
not already exist.

If you do find an existing issue for what you wanted to report, please include
your own feedback in the discussion. Do consider upvoting (üëç reaction) the original
post, as this helps us prioritize popular issues in our backlog.
